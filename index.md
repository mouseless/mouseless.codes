Inventiv is the technology subsidiary of Multinet | Up, specializing in payment
technology. They have a strong in-house software development culture, providing
us with the opportunity to explore innovative ways to develop software. This led
us to create their backend framework, Gazel, and their service
framework, Routine, both in .NET.
