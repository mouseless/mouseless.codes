We offer our expertise through the software increments we develop.

As a software development collective, we operate on a __time & materials__
basis. We function as a __self-managing team__ with a single point of contact
assigned to you.

We position ourselves as a __staff augmentation__ service provider, offering
full responsibility for software systems that you'd rather outsource. This
allows you to maintain your focus on your core business concerns.

## Custom Software Development

We help you progress.

We advise our clients to prioritize core product features and leverage pre-built
software solutions for non-core needs. While this approach suits startups and
early-stage products, there comes a point where custom development becomes
essential, even for complementary functions like notification services and
integration systems.

That's where we come in. We offer our services to ensure you can maintain your
focus on core business concerns without compromising your custom requirements.

We're a self-managing software engineering team, handling the entire development
process from design and planning to implementation, with all technical aspects,
including maintenance and upgrades, professionally managed out of the box to
ensure a seamless experience for you.

how we can assist you.

## Re-engineering

We help you maintain focus.

If you have custom-developed software serving as a secondary system, it's
probable that this software may eventually become outdated and miss out on
essential technology upgrades. This occurs because organizations naturally
prioritize their core business challenges over technical needs of auxiliary
systems. This creates a persistent problem that requires professional attention.

We're more than willing to offer our expertise to take the full responsibility
for such systems. Through this approach, we aim to create a win-win scenario. It
enables your workforce to focus on core business concerns while granting us an
opportunity to address engineering challenges.

how we can assist you.

## Long-term Partnership

We value trust.

Software development requires a keen focus. It's not something achievable
through a short-term deal. At Mouseless, we consider trust-building a
fundamental step to have a high-performing team. Let's connect, establish a
long-term partnership, and explore the possibilities together.
