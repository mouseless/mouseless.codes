We offer our expertise through the software increments we develop.

As a software development collective, we basically work on a __time &
materials__ basis. We work as __a self managing team__ with a single point of
contact assigned to you.

Within this model we position ourselves as an __IT staff augmentation__ service,
where we take the full responsibility of software system(s) that you prefer to
be dealt with externally so that you keep your focus on your core business
concerns.

## Re-engineering

If your organization uses a custom software developed specifically to support
your core operations, this software is likely to become legacy and lack the
necessary technology upgrades. This occurs because your organization naturally
prioritize its core business problems over these side system technical
requirements.

This causes a chronic problem that requires to be addressed by a professional
service. We are more than happy to offer our expertise to take the full
responsibility of such systems. This way we aim to create a win-win situation,
where you focus your work force on your core business challenges while we find a
chance to solve several engineering challenges.
