### A software development collective;
# Connected through the craft

Our collective is a team of software engineers guided by our people-centric
philosophy, focusing on delivering quality work collaboratively.

### Our structure

At Mouseless, we function as a cohesive software development collective. Our
structure is designed to promote collaboration and communication, aligning with
our people-centric philosophy.

#text

Within our collective, one of our engineers serves as the single point of
contact who manages all client communications and operations seamlessly while
we, as Mouseless, focus on delivering software increments continuously.

### Why a collective?

A collective is inherently centered around its people, creating an environment
of communication and efficiency. In contrast, a business centers on its core
product vision, emphasizing product delivery, regardless of obstacles.

When faced with an inevitable choice between the product and the people,
collectives lean toward their people, whereas businesses lean toward their
products.

Recognizing this, we've chosen to be a collective.

### People-centric

We prioritize our people above all else, promoting open communication and
efficiency. With this philosophy, our collective keeps its focus on its craft
which eventually leads to excellence.

### Passionate

As software engineers, we constantly debate over better and cleaner ways to
write code, even after its delivery. It's not just about the end product; it's
the inherently elegant and fascinating nature of the work itself that keeps us
engaged.

#efficient

::::card{image="images/our-collective/efficient.png"}

### Efficient

We prioritize quality over speed, understanding that rushing can result in
costly errors. To achieve a balance between quality and productivity, we employ
effective scope management and incremental delivery.

#unconventional

::::card{image="images/our-collective/unconventional.png"}

### Unconventional

It is our path to evolution. It involves trying and experimenting, embracing new
approaches even when they make us feel strange and uneasy. We are perfectly fine
with stepping out of the comfort zone, inviting the unconventional.

::::

#excellent

::::card{image="images/our-collective/excellent.png"}

### Excellent

We view perfection as doing the best we can each day, understanding that it's a
dynamic goal, not an unchanging ideal. With this perspective, we pursue
excellence in our work every day.
