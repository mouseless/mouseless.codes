We like to develop software, together.

We are a software development collective that is centered around its engineers.
We develop tailor-made software and re-engineer legacy code to help our
customers to focus their development teams on their core business concerns.

We are, and will always be, a small team that consists of 3-7 software
engineers.

## Why a collective?

People over business.

Teams are centered around their people. This property alone is a constant
invitation for any team to be communicative, productive and creative.

A business centric organization is centered around its core product vision. This
means when a company have to choose between the product and the people, it will
choose its core product over the people.

We think that this introduces a direct conflict with the idea of being a team.
So we've chosen to be a collective.
