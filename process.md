## **We** experiment, learn and progress

We run on a flexible, pay-as-you-go model. We prioritize timely feature
delivery, automated testing, code refactoring, and keeping technology up to date
without extra cost.

to maintain code quality. We keep our technology up to date __at no extra cost__
to our clients.

### Cross Pollination

Our development style produces high-quality software which requires considerable
effort. To provide top-tier services that are also cost-effective, we follow a
philosophy of cross-pollination by open sourcing everything we own. This
approach ensures our clients avoid potential risks of depending on a service
provider and allows them to benefit from our total experience.

## Engagement Model

**We** are self-organized.

:::

We are a __self-managing__ team with a single point of contact assigned per
client. We operate on a __time & materials__ basis without requiring a
fixed-budget or a fixed-plan thanks to our fast response time.
