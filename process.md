We experiment, learn and progress.

We run on a flexible, pay-as-you-go model. We prioritize timely feature
delivery, automated testing, code refactoring, and keeping technology up to date
without extra cost.

## How We Work

We are self-organized.

We operate as a self-managing team of engineers. When you share your
requirements with your single point of contact, our team of engineers take it
from there. No long-term commitments required â€“ it's a pay-as-you-go model.

Our process includes;

- Delivering features with an average lead time of __3 days__.
- Employing __automated tests__ for robustness.
- Engaging in __constant refactoring__ to maintain code quality.
- Keeping our technlogy up to date __at no extra cost__ to our clients.

## Transparency Matters

We value transparency.

To keep our clients informed, we maintain;

- __Draft pull requests__ that are opened as soon as a work begins.
- Well detailed __task lists__.
- Open discussions in __GitHub__.
- Clear __commit messages__.

## Open Source

We are open.

While our development style produces high-quality software, it requires
considerable effort. To provide top-tier services that are also cost-effective,
we follow a philosophy of cross-pollination by open sourcing everything we own.

## Continuous Learning

We are eager.

When we encounter something new, we pause our active work-in-progress, put on
our learning hats and create a pull request in the corresponding `learn-`
repository.
