We own _how_ we do.

We know that we're truly productive only when we do things in our way. So we
take full responsibility and ownership of _how_ we develop.

We experiment, learn and progress.

### Our Process

We are agile.

We are self-managing team of engineers. You give a little brief to your single
point of contact. A self-managing team of engineers examine and develop what you
need.

No commitment required, it is pay-as-you-go.

We respect all the technical necessities of being agile in software development.

- We deliver features within __3 days__ of development lead time on average.
- We utilize __automated tests__.
- We __refactor__ constantly.
- We update our technology __without any cost__ to our customers.

We create __transparency__ through;

- draft pull requests that are opend as soon as a work has started
- well detailed task lists
- open discussions in GitHub
- and clean commit messages.

### Open Source

We are open.

Our development style produces high quality software but it requires a lot of
effort. To maintain our services in high quality while being affordable, we've
built a strong cross-pollination mindset. So we open source everything we own.

See what we've [open sourced][github-repos].

### Continuous Learning

We are eager.

When we realize we don't know how to do something, we pause our active work, put
on the learning hat and create a pull request in the corresponding `learn-`
repository.

See what we've been [learning][github-learn].
