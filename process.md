## **We** experiment, learn and progress

We run on a flexible, pay-as-you-go model. We prioritize timely feature
delivery, automated testing, code refactoring, and keeping technology up to date
without extra cost.

## How **We** Work

**We** are self-organized.

:::

We are a __self-managing__ team with a single point of contact assigned per
client. We operate on a __time & materials__ basis without requiring a
fixed-budget or a fixed-plan thanks to our fast response time.

Our efficiency relies on;

- Delivering features with an average lead time of __3 days__.

## Transparency Matters

:::banner

**We** value transparency.

To keep our clients informed, **we** maintain;

:::

:::bullet-list

- __Draft pull requests__ that are opened as soon as a work begins.
- Well detailed __task lists__.
- Open discussions in __GitHub__.
- Clear __commit messages__.

## Open Source

:::banner

**We** are open.

:::

Our development style produces high-quality software which requires considerable
effort. To provide top-tier services that are also cost-effective, we follow a
philosophy of cross-pollination by open sourcing everything we own. This
approach ensures our clients avoid potential risks of depending on a service
provider and allows them to benefit from our total experience.

## Continuous Learning

:::banner

**We** are eager.

:::

When we encounter something new, we pause our active work-in-progress, put on
our learning hats and create a pull request in the corresponding `learn-`
repository.
