## What are we?

We like to develop software, together.

We are a software development collective that is centered around its engineers.
We develop tailor-made software and re-engineer legacy code to help our
customers to focus their development teams on their core business concerns.

We are, and will always be, a small team that consists of 3-7 software
engineers.

### Why a collective?

People over business.

Teams are centered around their people. This property alone is a constant
invitation for any team to be communicative, productive and creative.

A business centric organization is centered around its core product vision. This
means when a company have to choose between the product and the people, it will
choose its core product over the people.

We think that this introduces a direct conflict with the idea of being a team.
So we've chosen to be a collective.

## How do we work?

We own _how_ we do.

We know that we're truly productive only when we do things in our way. So we
take full responsibility and ownership of _how_ we develop.

We experiment, learn and progress.

We sell our expertise through the software increments we develop for you.

### Our Process

<!-- TODO -->

  messages

### Open Source

We are open.

Our development style produces high quality software but it requires a lot of
effort. To maintain our services in high quality while being affordable, we've
built a strong cross-pollination mindset. So we open source everything we own.
