##### [Why a collective?]()

:hr

:::

A collective is inherently centered around its people, creating an environment
of communication and efficiency. In contrast, a business centers on its core
product vision, emphasizing product delivery, regardless of obstacles.

When faced with an inevitable choice between the product and the people,
collectives lean toward their people, whereas businesses lean toward their
products.

Recognizing this, we've chosen to be a collective.

##### [What risks do I face when working with a collective?]()

:hr

:::

The risks have never been lower. When you engage with a company, your agreement
typically guarantees your bond with its legal entity, not its personnel.

At Mouseless, we prioritize our people over their legal entities. We work
together not only for business reasons, but also due to our shared interest in
the profession of software engineering.

This structure provides our clients with low turnover while maintaining
professional relationships through the companies of our people.
