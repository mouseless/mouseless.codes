##### [Why a collective?]()

:hr

:::

A collective is inherently centered around its people, creating an environment
of communication and efficiency. In contrast, a business centers on its core
product vision, emphasizing product delivery, regardless of obstacles.

When faced with an inevitable choice between the product and the people,
collectives lean toward their people, whereas businesses lean toward their
products.

Recognizing this, we've chosen to be a collective.
