#### [How do you work without deadlines?]()

:::

In our experience, strict deadlines often indicate a lack of trust. To build
trust, our initial offer is always a time-and-materials-based contract, allowing
our clients the flexibility to cancel at any time without compromise.

Once this trust is established, we start delivering small software increments
and ask our clients to give it 3-4 weeks to start creating value. After about
6-8 small increments, we both gain a better understanding of what the project
will look like and how fast it will evolve.

In short, we focus our time on developing the actual software instead of making
estimates about it, while giving our clients the opportunity to cancel at any
time.

#### [How does it differ from a turnkey project management style?]()

:::

It depends on what you mean by turnkey. If you mean having a fixed scope before
we start working on a project, this is not our way of managing software
development. However, we are perfectly fine with fixed-budget project
management. With a fixed budget, we can start developing right away and make
prioritizations and detailed analyses on the go.

#### [Is there a support phase in iterative development approaches?]()

:::

Yes. We see software development as continuous work that starts with a minimal
scope and builds upon it in every iteration. What we do is create a minimum
viable and functional software and deploy it to production as soon as possible,
usually within 2-4 weeks. We then continue developing new versions while
providing support for the production version.

If you find a version sufficient at any given moment, we focus on maintaining it
by addressing bugs and issues, as well as applying technology upgrades.
