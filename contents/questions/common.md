##### [What business domains does Mouseless work in?]()

:hr

:::

We don't limit our services to certain business domains by definition. Our
business domain is software development itself, and we offer our services to
those who have expertise in their own business domains.

That being said, we have more experience in Fintech, Shipping and Delivery,
E-Commerce, SaaS, and Agile Software Development.

##### [What technologies do you have experience in?]()

:hr

:::

It's widely accepted that empowering senior software engineers to select their
preferred tech stack tends to produce successful outcomes. Mouseless is no
different. We work as an autonomous software development team, where we expect
our clients to give us this freedom.

Our current expertise lies in __C#__ and __.NET__ in the backend, and __Vue__ +
__Nuxt__ in the frontend. We also have experience in __Java__ and __Spring__ in
the backend, as well as __React__ and __Blazor__ in the frontend.

We're actively exploring __Go__ and __Flutter__ as well. If you need help with
those, we are eager to embrace the opportunity.

##### [What are your pricing options?]()

:hr

:::

We operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning you only pay for the work
completed. There are no extra management or HR costs for you. Additionally, we
handle technology upgrades for the software systems we maintain at no additional
cost, leveraging our cross-pollination and open-source approach.

Each engineer has a seniority rate that determines their monthly contribution.
This helps us calculate costs transparently. Our single price policy makes it
easy for you to compare our services with other providers.
