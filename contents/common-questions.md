#### [How do you work without deadlines?]()

:hr

:::

We work with deadlines only when they are truly necessary, which is almost never
the case. In our experience, strict deadlines often indicate a lack of trust. To
build trust, our initial offer is always a time-and-materials-based contract,
allowing our clients the flexibility to cancel at any time without compromise.

Once this trust is established, we start delivering small software increments
and ask our clients to give it 3-4 weeks to start creating value. After about
6-8 small increments, we both gain a better understanding of what the project
will look like and how fast it will evolve.

In short, we focus our time on developing the actual software instead of making
estimates about it, while giving our clients the opportunity to cancel at any
time.
