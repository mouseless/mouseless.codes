#meet

#### Meet

Leave a message about your company and your needs. We will contact you back in a
short time to arrange an initial call where we meet and see how we can
collaborate.

#proposal

#### Proposal

We will prepare a service proposal to set up a collaboration ground. Details of
this proposal will depend on how deep we dive during the first meeting.

#decide

#### Decide

Once we find a common ground to collaborate, we move further and negotiate. Upon
this negotiation, our team will be ready to work whenever you need a support.

#deliver

#### Deliver

You provide us with a roughly prioritized set of work items and let us deliver
working software within an average of 3-day lead-time. At this point you will
receive a monthly progress report where you can see cost of each work item
separately.
