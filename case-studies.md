## Inventiv - Multinet | Up

[Inventiv][] is the technology subsidiary of [Multinet | Up][], specializing in
payment technology. They have a strong in-house software development culture,
providing us with the opportunity to explore innovative ways to develop
software. This led us to create their backend framework, [Gazel][], and their
service framework, [Routine][], both in .NET.

We were directly responsible for Gazel's entire development. Our tasks included
introducing new features, planning and managing releases, researching and
implementing the latest .NET advancements into the framework, managing
technology upgrades, and maintaining the framework's documentation.

The majority of Inventiv's software runs on Gazel, efficiently processing
millions of daily payment transactions for _Multinet | Up_ card users.

### History

We initiated the design and development of _Multinet | Up_'s framework, with the
first version released in 2014. We've open-sourced Routine, and turn their
internal framework into the product it is today.

This 10 year journey has been invaluable in teaching us how to tackle the
challenges of creating an open-source product, for which we'll always be
grateful.

buyer experience they provide.
