We work to create a collective value.

## Forward

[Forward][] is a sales enablement tool that helps B2B companies to increase
their buyer engagement through digital sales rooms that can be shared with a
single link.

Their product requires lots of integrations, especially to CRM systems. This is
where we kicked in. We are currently helping them to create an integration
gateway. This way we help them to keep their focus on the seller and buyer
experience they create.

### History

We have worked in several projects with the team of Forward some of which goes
back to 2015, even before our collective was born. Having this strong
relationship in the background, we are more than happy to help Forwardians to
achieve their goals.

## Flopal

[Flopal][] is a raised floor systems manifacturing company, operating since
early '90s. Their internal business processes were renewed in 2014 with which
they decided to develop a custom software solution for their production,
procurement and sales processes.

We're providing them with a well structured backend framework and a solid
runtime admin UI generation tool so that they can be productive and responsive
in terms of their custom software needs.

### History

Flopal has always been an enabler for us to discover our unique way of
developing software. Thanks to this long-term partnership that goes back to
2011, we were courageous when establishing our collective.

## Inventiv

[Inventiv][] is founded as the technology subsidiary of _Multinet | Up_ and is a
payment technology copmany. They have a strong in-house software development
mindset for which they utilize a software development framework in .NET.

We were directly responsible for the development of their in-house framework,
[Gazel][], researching, applying new features of .NET, managing technology
upgrades, delivering new features along with maintaining the documentation.

Almost all of Inventiv's software runs on Gazel framework, everyday handling
millions of payment transactions of _Multinet | Up_ with high-performance.

### History

We designed and developed _Multinet | Up_'s framework with the first version
released in 2014. We also open-sourced the service framework, [Routine][] which
is a technology that Gazel uses as a service framework on top of ASP.NET.

This was a 10 year journey that helped us learn how to overcome struggles of
creating an open-source product, for which we'll always be grateful.
