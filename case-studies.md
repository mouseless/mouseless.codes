[Yurtiçi Kargo][] is one of Turkey's leading logistics companies, offering
reliable and efficient parcel delivery services nationwide. With a strong focus
on innovation, they continuously enhance their operations through technology and
customer-focused solutions.

Their internal dashboard portal was outdated, making it an ideal candidate for
our services. We successfully kicked off the project to rewrite the software
using modern technologies and a refreshed user interface.

### Our history

Our connection dates back to the late 2000s, when we developed Yurtiçi Kargo's
first mobile application, along with many other projects.

Yurtiçi Kargo's strong corporate culture demands high-quality software, shaping
us over the years to balance excellence and efficiency.

## Inventiv - Multinet Up

We've built [Inventiv][]'s internal software development framework [Gazel][] and

[Inventiv][] is the technology subsidiary of [Multinet Up][], specializing in
payment technology. They have a strong in-house software development culture,
providing us with the opportunity to explore innovative ways to develop
software. This led us to create their backend framework, [Gazel][], and their
service framework, [Routine][], both in .NET.

The majority of Inventiv's software runs on Gazel, efficiently processing
millions of daily payment transactions for _Multinet Up_ card users.

We were directly responsible for Gazel's entire development. Our tasks included
introducing new features, planning and managing releases, researching and
implementing the latest .NET advancements into the framework, managing
technology upgrades, and maintaining the framework's documentation.

### Our history

We initiated the design and development of _Multinet Up_'s framework, with the
first version released in 2014. We've open-sourced Routine, and turn their
internal framework into the product it is today.

This 10 year journey has been invaluable in teaching us how to tackle the
challenges of creating an open-source product, for which we'll always be
grateful.

We've built the integration gateway server for [Forward][]'s web app to allow
their customers integrate with CRM and more.

[Forward][] is a sales enablement tool that empowers B2B companies to enhance
their buyer engagement through digital sales rooms, shared with a single link.

Their product requires lots of integrations, particularly with CRM systems. This
is where we came in. Currently, we are helping them establish an integration
gateway, ensuring they can maintain their focus on enhencing the seller and
buyer experience they provide.

### Our history

We have collaborated on several projects with the Forward team, with some dating
back to 2015, even before our collective was born. With this strong
relationship, we are happy to support Forwardians in achieving their goals.
